Saquon Barkley received 48 of 50 first-place votes and Patrick Surtain II got 49 from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league.

"Wow, that's crazy. That's respect right there. That's love," Jefferson said of his unanimous selection and second overall.

Jackson received 30 first-place votes to Allen's 18, making the team for the second straight year and third overall. Peyton Manning (7) and Aaron Rodgers (4) are the only quarterbacks with more All-Pro nominations in the Super Bowl era than Jackson.

Linebacker Roquan Smith, slot cornerback Marlon Humphrey and fullback Patrick Ricard joined Jackson from the Baltimore Ravens (12-5).

The NFC-leading Detroit Lions (15-2) had four players selected: wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, right tackle Penei Sewell, safety Kerby Joseph and punter Jack Fox.

"They know what's up," said Joseph, who led the NFL with nine interceptions but was snubbed from the Pro Bowl.

Barkley, who ran for 2,005 yards in 16 games in his first season with the Eagles (14-3), and linebacker Zack Baun were Philadelphia's first-team selections. Barkley sat out the final regular-season game with the Eagles locked into the No. 2 seed instead of chasing Eric Dickerson's 40-year-old single-season rushing record.

Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett and San Francisco 49ers linebacker Fred Warner were each chosen for the fourth time.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers left tackle Tristan Wirfs became the first player selected at both tackle spots. Before 2016, the All-Pro roster included two tackles but didn't differentiate between right or left side. Wirfs made it at right tackle in 2021. He switched positions in 2023.

"It's pretty special," Wirfs said. "It's something I wanted to do, wanted to accomplish."

Fourteen players are first-timers, including Las Vegas Raiders rookie tight end Brock Bowers. He got 27 first-place votes to George Kittle's 22.

Kansas City Chiefs center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney and Denver Broncos right guard Quinn Meinerz round out the offense.

Cincinnati's Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL with 17½ sacks, joined Garrett at edge rusher.

"That's such a privilege and an honor," Hendrickson said.

Kansas City's Chris Jones and Pittsburgh's Cameron Heyward are the interior defensive linemen. Houston Texans cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. and Green Bay Packers safety Xavier McKinney joined Surtain, Humphrey and Joseph in the secondary.

"That's a huge honor," Surtain said. "That's one of the accolades I definitely had goals for."

Stingley, the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 chosen right before two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner, rebounded from two-injury plagued seasons and played every game to help Houston win its second straight AFC South title.

"It's really more about the secondary as a unit, how do we jell together when it comes to communication, when the ball is in the air and different types of things like that. I'd rather focus more on that than the personal," Stingley said.

Steelers kicker Chris Boswell, Cowboys kick returner KaVontae Turpin, Broncos punt returner Marvin Mims Jr., Patriots special teams ace Brenden Schooler and Vikings long snapper Andrew DePaola along with Fox were the special teams picks.

Jackson also was an All-Pro in 2019 and 2023. He was the NFL MVP both of those seasons, when Baltimore had the AFC's No. 1 seed but failed to reach the Super Bowl. Joe Burrow received the two first-place votes at quarterback that didn't go to Jackson and Allen.

Ravens running back Derrick Henry received the two first-place votes that didn't go to Barkley.

St. Brown (40), Thuney (41), Humphrey (44), Baun (44), Garrett (45) and Turpin (49) also had at least 40 of the 50 first-place votes.

This was the third year for the AP's voting system. Voters chose a first team and a second team. First-team votes are worth 3 points, while second-team votes are worth 1.



The New York Jets, Cleveland Browns and Jacksonville Jaguars will each serve as the home team for games in London next season as part of the NFL's growing slate of international play, the league announced Friday.

The Jets and the Browns will play at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while the Jaguars will host their game at Wembley Stadium.

The Browns and Jets both enter 2025 with unsettled quarterback situations. Cleveland was anticipating the return of Deshaun Watson after he suffered a season-ending Achilles tear in October, though league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Watson tore the Achilles again and underwent surgery Thursday. The Browns are expected to look to add to their quarterback room via free agency or the draft, where they have the No. 2 overall pick.

The Jets, meanwhile, face an uncertain future with the 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers, who said he would "think about my future in the game" after the team's season finale Sunday.



New York played in London this season, falling to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17. This will mark the franchise's fifth international game and fourth in London.

The Browns have played in London once, losing 33-16 to the Vikings in 2017.

The Jaguars will continue their annual visit to Wembley Stadium, where they have a deal with the NFL in which they have full responsibility for the game and oversee all operations. The past two seasons the Jaguars have played back-to-back games in London -- one as the home team at Wembley and the other as the visiting team at Tottenham.

Beginning with the 2025 season, the NFL can schedule up to eight international regular-season games per year. The league previously announced that it will play a regular-season game in Berlin for the first time in 2025 and one in Madrid.

Opponents, game dates and kickoff times will be announced when the 2025 schedule is released in the spring.











MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- There were moments this season when Mitch Jeter simply could not make a kick, as injuries to his hip and groin ruined his form and threatened to sink his confidence.

But over the past month, as he got healthy, he turned into "Mr. January." As a result, Notre Dame is headed to its first national championship game since 2013, with an opportunity to win its first title since 1988.

The Irish say they have built their season on resilience -- and it is possible nobody on the team embodies that more than Jeter. As he lined up for a 41-yard field goal attempt with the score tied at 24 and 12 seconds left on the clock against Penn State on Thursday night, all he could think was: "Let's go make it."

Jeter pushed the football through the uprights to give Notre Dame a 27-24 win in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl. In doing so, he became the first kicker to make a go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter of a playoff game.

"Coach [Marcus] Freeman talks a lot about delayed gratification," Jeter said. "He's been talking like that all the way back to Week 2, when the [loss to Northern Illinois] happened. So it's kind of been my mindset, going through an injury, having delayed gratification now to be able to come out and give our team a chance to go win a national championship."

In addition, Freeman is the first Black head coach to have a chance to win a college football national championship.

Jeter was not the only player who stepped up big Thursday night. Many of those clutch performances came from unexpected players. Cornerback Christian Gray came up with a huge play to set up the game-winning field goal, when he intercepted Penn State quarterback Drew Allar with 30 seconds left.

Defensive coordinator Al Golden called the play by the sophomore "amazing" because he recognized what Allar was doing and beat his receiver to the ball.

"Christian got a great break on it," Golden said. "And generally speaking, that kid works really hard on his hands, so if he has an opportunity to catch it, he usually does."

Added Freeman: "In that moment, Christian had to make a play and he did and was a huge reason why we won that game."

A game that was an offensive slog for the first three quarters turned into a back-and-forth contest in the fourth, as the teams combined to score four touchdowns in less than 10 minutes.

Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, playing with a knee brace and at less than 100%, got the scoring going in the final quarter with a remarkable second effort from the 2-yard line, when he jumped through one tackle, stayed on his feet and dragged a defender with him into the end zone as his legs refused to stop moving to give the Irish a 17-10 lead.

Love usually celebrates his touchdowns by making a heart shape with his hands. But he forgot in the heat of the moment.

"I don't know what I was on that play, but I felt like some extra strength," Love said. "I just wanted to scream and rage. I just felt like the Hulk or something. I wasn't even thinking about throwing up the heart. It was just expressing the dominance I just asserted over them."

Penn State answered with two touchdown drives to take a 24-17 lead with 7:55 remaining. That is when Irish sophomore wide receiver Jaden Greathouse took his turn in the spotlight. On second-and-8 from the Notre Dame 46-yard line with 4:38 to go, Riley Leonard stepped back to throw. Greathouse made a move on Cam Miller, who fell down -- leaving Greathouse wide open in the middle of the field.

Leonard lofted the ball, and Greathouse caught it. He had a safety to beat, and one juke move later, Greathouse was in the end zone for a 54-yard touchdown pass to tie the score at 24.

"While I was out there, I really got a flashback to my 7-on-7 days in high school, and it was a similar play," Greathouse said. "And I was like, 'I just need to cut inside and I'll be in the end zone celebrating.'"

Greathouse finished with seven catches for 105 yards and a score -- the first 100-yard game of his career. He missed two days of practice earlier in the week because he was sick but said he woke up Thursday and believed, "Tonight is going to be my first 100-yard game."

That brought things back to Jeter and his opportunity to break a tie at 24. His injury saga goes back to Week 4, when he took a hit to a hip on an errant field goal snap against Miami (Ohio). He played through it, but a few weeks later against Stanford, he injured his groin. As time went on, his bones were not in perfect alignment -- and that affected his form.

Jeter missed four of his five field goal attempts in the final four games of the regular season. His father, Andrew, works as a chiropractor and offered to help get his body back into alignment. He would come to South Bend on Thursdays and then stay for several days to help Jeter get his body aligned so everything could heal properly.

"Bones were in places that they shouldn't have been," Jeter said. "That was my femur, my back, my hips. He was able to move those bones back into position where they're supposed to be, which allowed the healing process to almost accelerate."

Once the playoffs started, Jeter felt 100%. It has shown in his performance, as Jeter has gone 7-of-8 in three playoff games -- including several clutch kicks in the quarterfinal win against Georgia too.

Quarterback Steve Angeli -- another player who stepped up big, leading a field goal drive late in the first half with Leonard out of the game -- said the team has nicknamed Jeter "Mr. January."

"He is a confident guy, man," Freeman said. "There is no moment too big for Mitch Jeter. I had a lot of confidence in him in that moment that he was going to do exactly what he did, and he did a great job at doing that."
